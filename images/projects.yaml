    GoodWealth is personal finance management application from Litec solutions. The app serves to:

    * Help you automatically capture financial transactions across multiple bank accounts regardless of the bank.
    * Give you a 360 degree real-time and accurate view of finances.

    My role has been to convert business requirements into working app. I have been the overall technical lead for the app.

    color: '#F1F1F1'
    color2: 'material teal 500'
    caption: "Like many other designers, I've switched to using Sketch for most of my UI work. In my unrelenting quest to improve my own productivity, I started writing Sketch plugins. [Sketch Artboard Tricks](https://github.com/romannurik/sketch-artboardtricks) is one that I wrote that many designers on my current team now use."

    device_frame: browser
    caption: The [Android Asset Studio](http://j.mp/androidassetstudio) was one of the first tools I wrote, aiming to take the guesswork out of Android app icon sizing and effects. Plug in some values and it generates all the necessary assets for each screen density.

    caption: The [Layer Visualizer](https://github.com/romannurik/LayerVisualizer) was a quick tool I built for helping [teach material design](https://www.udacity.com/course/material-design-for-android-developers--ud862), specifically the depth relationships of material surfaces. [See on Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/2238573-Google-I-O-App-Layer-Visualization)

    color2: 'material deep-orange 500'
    caption: "[Android Design Preview](https://github.com/romannurik/AndroidDesignPreview) is a tool I co-wrote that allows designers to get a more realistic view of their UIs by mirroring a portion of their computer screen to an Android device."

  - video: tools_ninepatch
    color: 'material light-blue 100'
    color2: '#0099CC'
    device_frame: browser
    caption: Nine-patches are notoriously tedious to produce, especially in bulk. I built the [nine-patch generator](http://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/nine-patches.html), to simplify the process of creating optimized nine-patches for all densities.

    color2: '#6ab344'
    device_frame: browser
    caption: I recognized several years ago that developers were using device frames inconsistently, with poor lighting/sheen, shadows, etc. I decided to make an easy-to-use [generator](http://developer.android.com/distribute/tools/promote/device-art.html) for Nexus device-framed images.
